Next.js is a framework that makes it easy to create Universal web apps in React. With Next.js, React pages are automatically rendered on both client and server side, without the hassle of setting up dependancies like webpack or babel and with automatic routing.

This is a starter project that provides an example of how to use Next.js with Express (the popular web server framework for Node.js), with CSS, Bootstrap, reactstrap (Boostrap 4 for React).

This project exists to make it easier to get started with creating universal apps in React. You are invited to use it as a reference or to copy it and use it as a base for your own projects. Contributions to improve this project are welcome.
